	<p>Formerly known as South hall (renamed in 2010), Hyer is a little more removed from the rest of the campus, and is home to older and non-traditional students.  South hall was renamed when the Suites at 201 (formerly the site of Hyer hall) were built.  The building is dedicated in 1963 to Frank S. Hyer, who was the president of the campus from 1930 to 1938, and who was responsible for helping the college flourish during the Great Depression.  Inside the dorm each room is single-occupancy, which makes this dorm ideal for the student who wants to complete their studies at UW-Stevens Point.</p>
