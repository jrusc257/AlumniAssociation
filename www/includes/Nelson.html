	<p>As the second-oldest building on-campus, Nelson Hall was originally constructed in 1915 as the first female residence hall. At one point, it hosted the arts and dance classes while the Noel Fine Arts Center was under construction. However, the university's gradual expansion led to Nelson Hall becoming more of a monument than a building with notable activity. Even though occupation of the former residence hall by students or faculty is minimal, the building has been protected by the Wisconsin Historical Preservation Society to this day. There have been rumors that the building is haunted, because of the stories that one girl committed suicide in the hall while another person died from epilepsy. Nelson Hall even hosted a haunted house event at one point.</p>
    <p>Despite the ghost stories that surround the building, the building still hosts organizations that couldn't find a good home in other areas. One such organization is Upward Bound, which helps underprivileged high school students prepare for success in college and has occupied the building since 1968. Other organizations that reside the building include Wisconsin Nicaragua, the Vet Center, and the Literacy Council. Along with those organizations, Custodial Services occupies the basement of Nelson Hall. Even though its glory days as a residence hall are long gone, the classic architecture and hosting of different organizations help to preserve the importance of Nelson Hall to the university. It stands alone as a piece of the campus legacy undeterred by the passing of time.</p>
