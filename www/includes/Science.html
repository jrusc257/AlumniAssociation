	<p>Originally constructed as two separate buildings, an add-on that connected the two buildings transformed them into the West and East wings of what is now known as the Science Building. Past and current students sometimes complain about getting lost in the building because of this add-on. However, this unique building has a lot to offer curious students; for starters, at the entrance of the East Wing is the Foucault Pendulum. This exhibit reproduces a famous science experiment first performed in 1851 by the French physicist named Jean Foucault.</p>
    <p>If you want a fun way to educate yourself, your friends, or young children, then the Allen F. Blocher Planetarium in the East Wing is a great place to go. The planetarium consists of a 7.3m diameter dome that houses a Spitz 1024 projector (installed in 1998). The planetarium presents public programs through the academic year and during most summers. For stargazers in the West Wing, you can go to the Arthur J. Pejsa Observatory on the fourth floor. If the skies are clear, the observatory is open from Monday to Wednesday, from 8:30pm to 10:00pm. It is staffed by knowledgeable astronomy students and staff who will find and describe various interesting objects that can be seen in the current night-time sky, then they will allow visitors to observe them through a 0.4m (16-inch), computer-controlled Meade telescope.</p>
    <p>The Science Building also hosts many different organizations, such as the Wisconsin Institute for Sustainable Technology, the UWSP Paper Science Foundation, the UWSP Museum of Natural History, and the Association of Information Technology Professionals. In the basement of the Science Building is the Printing and Design Services office, which allows individuals or organizations to file requests for materials such as posters, flyers, and business cards.</p>
