	<p>Lake Joanis was constructed in 1976 and named in 1994. The lake has a surface area of 23 acres and an estimated volume of 277 acre-feet with a maximum depth of 25 feet. The bottom of the lake consists of sand and fine gravel. The lake was named after John W. Joanis, who was the CEO at Sentry Insurance, Stevens Point, until his death in 1987. He was a friend and ambassador for UW – Stevens Point. He had a hand in creating the lake in Schmeekle Reserve by negotiating with UW-SP for dirt from the reserve to be used for Sentry World’s parking lot. The hole left from the dirt removal became the lake bearing his name.</p>
