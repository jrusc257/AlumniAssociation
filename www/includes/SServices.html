	<p>The Student Services Building is located at 1108 Fremont Street. It was originally constructed as a library in 1953 at a cost of $628,440. In 1970, when the James H. Albertson Center for Learning Resources was completed, it then became a student services center, named after Judge Byron B. Park. Judge Park served as a member of the Board of Regents of the State Normal Schools between 1892 and 1895 and was instrumental in Stevens Point being selected as the sixth normal school in the state. It took 101 ballots before Stevens Point finally won the battle over Wausau. Parkâ€™s daughter was enrolled as a model school child the first day the school opened in 1894.</p>
