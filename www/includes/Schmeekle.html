	<p>Schmeekle Reserve was farmland and grazing land before 1956. The land however wasnâ€™t fertile enough to support agriculture due to bedrock close to the surface. Several farmers had abandoned their efforts to make the ground agriculturally productive. The University began purchasing the land in 1956, and initially used it as a picnic area. By 1969 the University owned 127 acres and debated whether to use it for residence halls, housing for married students, athletic fields, or other options. But in1974 the University proposed to use the land for a natural area, with hiking trails and an arboretum. The Reserve was established in 1976 with a $250,000 Land and Water Conservation (LAWCON) Grant. One of the farms that were purchased was owned by the Edward Wojcik family. Their ranch house was converted into the Visitor Center by students over a period of three years.</p>

<p>The Schmeekle Reserve is the namesake of Fred Schmeekle. He began teaching at the Stevens Point Normal School in 1923. He taught agriculture when he first arrived, but in the early 1930s Schmeekle began teaching conservation courses. This program is now the largest undergraduate natural resources program of its kind in the nation.</p>
