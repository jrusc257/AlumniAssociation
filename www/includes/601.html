	<p>This building contains the residential living offices for UWSP, and also houses the Surplus Store.  Residential living cares for all the dorms on campus, and handles any issues students might encounter.  They make sure that students have what they need in the dorms, such as quiet study areas, computer labs, and hall programs to assist students.  The Surplus Store is where old equipment is taken when it has been retired from the campus so that it can be resold.  Anyone from the community can come and browse what the Surplus Store is selling, which in turn helps reduce disposal costs for the campus.  Through various federal and state programs, surplus items from the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point have also ended up in such places as Mexico, Bulgaria, Nicaragua, the West Indies, St. Thomas and other islands located in the Caribbean</p>
