	<p>Constructed for $900,000, this residence hall was dedicated to former president John Thomson. During his lifetime, he became the first president of the WSU-SP Foundation in 1965. Former governor Warren Knowler said of Thomson, “If Wisconsin ever establishes an educational hall of fame, John C. Thomson surely will have a place of honor in it.” From 1970 to 1974, it was set up as an all-female dormitory. Today, Thomson Hall hosts both male and female students in a “scattered” room configuration, hosting one of the social sciences/humanities freshman interest groups.</p>
