He was later appointed as the chancellor of the newly-branded UW - Stevens Point in 1972. Dreyfus ran for the position Governor of Wisconsin, successfully obtaining it in 1979 until the end of his term in 1983. On October 12, 2007, the University Center was officially renamed after Dreyfus. The DUC, as it's commonly-known, lives up to its name as the hub of many student activities. It was finished in 2007 after expanding and renovating a building that was already there, it hosts many types of activities including concerts, formal dinners, game nights, student organization meetings, and other special events. The DUC also hosts a food court and two coffee shops (HomeGrown Cafe and the Basement Brewhaus), with each gaining regular traffic throughout the school year. Whether you want to eat, study, relax, or hang out with friends, the DUC is the perfect hub for students.</p>
