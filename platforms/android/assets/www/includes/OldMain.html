	<p>Initially funded for $800, the building now known as Old Main officially opened its doors in 1894. When it first opened, Old Main was built to be the entire university and hosted all of the academic activities, including classes, academic affairs, and student centers. Even though it is no longer used for classes or recreational activities, there is still a sense of significance and beauty that the other buildings can't match. With its distinctive white cupola (which was renovated in 2011), Old Main houses administrative offices, including those of the Chancellor and Vice Chancellor. Even though it currently serves as the administrative center, there is an old classroom preserved for public viewing. Some interesting items in this room include a pipe organ and marble statues of notable ancient people. When you head to the second floor, you can see different versions of the logo under the university's many different names. Another thing that you can see up there is a portrait gallery depicting all of the former chancellors.</p>
