	<p>Originally a men's residence hall, this building was named in honor of Wilson S. Delzell, who was a member of the State Board of Normal School Regents and represented Stevens Point Normal School.  Wilson's father James Delzell was also a faculty member from 1915 until he retired in 1931, a director of the primary department, who also shares the honor of the name.  Delzell is now home to university Health Services, where enrolled students can receive free tuition-supported health care.  It is also home to the University Child Learning and Care Center, which provides families with on-campus child care, and a model educational and training environment for students and community partners involved in early childhood development, and teacher education. The building was first occupied in 1952, and was built at a cost of $365,570.</p>
