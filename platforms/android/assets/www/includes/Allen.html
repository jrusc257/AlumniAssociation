	<p>Built in 1964 the Allen Center was originally purposed as a food service facility, and is named for Professor Emiritus Bessie May Allen.  Miss Allen was chair of the Home Economics department for 39 years, and started with the Stevens Point Normal School in 1913.  She was the first woman ever elected to chair the faculty, serving in that position from 1943 to 1944.  Prior to her retirement in 1952, she anonymously established a scholarship fund that was awarded to an outstanding junior home economics major for use during their senior year.  The building was no longer used as a dining hall by 1992, and in 1996 started undergoing changes to become an aerobic fitness center.  In 2002 a proposal was submitted to remodel the upper floor into the current large exercise room.  The building first cost $659,000 to construct, and is over 18,000 square feet.</p>
