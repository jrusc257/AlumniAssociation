	<p>The mural that covers a large portion of the south wall of the science building was started in 1975,when chancellor Lee Sherman Dryfus approached art Professor Richard C. Schneider to cover the empty wall.  The mural features prominent images of a human figure, the Old Main Cupola, and a map of the Portage County area.  The mural also features important Wisconsin imagery such as a white-tailed deer, a muskie, robins, violets, native leader Black Hawk, and a maple leaf.  The design is made of 286,200 2 inch square tiles, each with a design representing disciplines in the natural resources department.  One campus legend says that there is a single red colored tile in the mural, and challenges students and visitors alike to find it.</p>
