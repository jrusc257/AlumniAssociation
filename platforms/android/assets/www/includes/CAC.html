	<p>The Communication Arts Center (CAC) is where most classes regarding communication major are held. There are several rooms dedicated to those who helped build our communication department. The Albert Croft Memorial Seminar Room was dedicated to Croft for the major revisions he did to the curriculum and the establishment of the communications department. Toby Goldberg got a lecture hall named after her for founding the University Film Society, raising awareness of the gender equality, and establishing special sections of communication fundamental for international students. The journalism center was named after Bertha Glennon because she was the advisor to The Pointer and to The Iris. In 1974 Chancellor Lee Sherman Dreyfus dedicated the campus radio station to Gertie Hanson Halsted because she was one of the first faculty members to develop programming for the radio station, as well as receiving an award from the National Education Conference for the program “The Halfway Mark.” It is also home to the campus radio station, WWSP-90FM. This station is student run, and it also hosts the annual Trivia on 45 which take place in April.</p>
