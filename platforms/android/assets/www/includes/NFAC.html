	<p>The Noel Fine Arts Center is part of the College of Fine Arts & Communication at UWSP, and contains facilities for Theatre, Dance, Design, Music, and Fine Arts.  Originally constructed in 1970 the NFAC was built at a cost of $4 million, and was recently renovated in 2005 to accommodate the excellent programs offered inside.  The building is named after John and Patty Noel, who have been large supporters of the community, and wanted to name the building in honor of their employees.  The NFAC is the only college in Wisconsin accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design, National Association of Schools of Dance, National Association of Schools of Music and National Association of Schools of Theatre, and is one of only 30 universities in the nation with those credentials.</p>
