	<p>It was dedicated in 1967 to Leland M. Burroughs, a former chair of the English department from 1920 to 1958. Burroughs gained recognition among Wisconsin writers for more than 500 poems he has written during a 40-year period, many of which have appeared in magazines and anthologies. This residence hall is known as the Wellness Hall. While all of the halls on campus focus on the concept of wellness, Burroughs Hall provides programming assistance to individuals interested in developing their own personal wellness goals and programs. The first and second floors are alcohol-free housing. On these two floors, individuals commit to neither possessing nor consuming alcohol. Men are housed on the first and third floors; women on the second and fourth floors.</p>
