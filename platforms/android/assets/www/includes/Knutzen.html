	<p>It was dedicated in 1967 to Norman E. Knutzen, a former English teacher at WSU-Stevens Point from 1926 to 1963 and founder/former director of the Men's Glee Club. The Men's Glee Club made 375 appearances to places throughout the country such as the New York World's Fair, West Point Military Academy, and the National Federation of Music Clubs convention in Miami, FL. Knutzen Hall is home to many natural resources majors â€“ an interesting fact to remember considering that they have been composting using worms in the front lobby since 1999. This residence hall also hosts one of the two Natural Resources freshman interest groups on campus. In 2004-2005, Knutzen began an experimental solar energy project designed to provide a supplemental energy source for the building.</p>
