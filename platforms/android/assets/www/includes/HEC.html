	<p>Located north of the Science Building's east wing, the Heath Enhancement Center is the home to many athletic activities. One of the main attractions to students looking for a healthy way to hang out is the Multi-Activity Center (MAC). Not only is the MAC open to students to run, play basketball, or go rock-climbing, but it also hosts track & field meets and other events such as Relay for Life and HEC of a Night. For students that want to improve their overall health, there is a weight room located on the east side of the building which allows entry to paid members or students in physical fitness classes. For students that want to serve in the military, the HEC has hosted the Military Science Department since October 2011. Students that decide to join the UWSP ROTC program meet in this building for their training.</p>
