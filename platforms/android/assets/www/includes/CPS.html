	<p>The College of Professional studies was established in 1970 to house many of the campusâ€™ pre-professional programs, such as business, economics, education, interior architecture, dietetics, health sciences, health promotion, athletic training, and clinical lab sciences.  The CPS specializes in preparing students for professional careers, developing their professional skills and abilities.  The CPS building also holds the CPS Cafe, which allows students to experience the dietetics aspects of food service operation and management of the cafe.  Most CPS programs are accredited by national accrediting bodies, including the American Dietetic Association, the American Speech Language and Hearing Association, the Foundation of Interior Design Education Research, the National Association of Schools of Art and Design, the Commission on the Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs, and the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Science.  Since its establishment, the CPS has only had three deans; Art Fritschel, Joan North, and the current dean Marty Loy.</p>
