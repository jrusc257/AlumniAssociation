	<p>In 1946 Stevens Point began the first conservation education major, and was officially established as the College of Natural Resources in 1970.  The College of Natural Resources provides undergraduate and graduate instruction that combines theoretical concepts with practical experience, such as laboratory and field oriented courses, internships and special projects.  The CNR is widely regarded as the nationâ€™s leading undergraduate natural resource program.  The strength of the program comes from its interdisciplinary approach and hands-on field experience.  This hands-on aspect is experienced in a variety of areas, including Schmeeckle Reserve, Treehaven educational facility.  With over 130 faculty and staff the College of Natural Resources is widely regarded as having the leading undergraduate natural resources program in the United States.</p>
